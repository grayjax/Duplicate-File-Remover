This works very well for removing duplicate files from the same folder.

This creates a hash for each file to determine duplicates and removes all but one dupe. 

Sometimes duplicate files have different names for whatever reason, so this allows for those to be removed as well.

Simply choose the folder with the dupes to remove and let it go to work.
